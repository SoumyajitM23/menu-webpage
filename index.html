	<div class="b2">Beef tenderloin is an extremely tender piece of meat, and is located in the loin. This is also where filet mignon is located, at the very tip of the tenderloin. Because of it being very lean and tender, it's one of the most expensive cuts of meat—but oh, is it worth it for its melt-in-your-mouth taste. Make sure not to overcook it to avoid it turning tough!
